# Overview

This is a very basic program that contains a few sandbox-y functions used while learning the basics of Typescript. 

Javascript is a requirement for web development, and Typescript is starting to come into its own as it can make Js development a lot easier.
As someone who would like to get into web development, it makes sense to learn how to use Typescript. 


# Development Environment

This program was written using Visual Studio Code for editing and Node.js for package management and deployment. 

This program was written using Typescript, along with ESLint for some quality of life error- checking.

# Future Work

There's not much to fix or improve given the simplicity of this program, but I'd like to use this knowledge for future projects:

- React- based resume page
- Personalized Music Player Webapp (modern Winamp)
